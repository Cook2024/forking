directions:
- Preheat oven to hot (400∘F).
- Use bread that is a little dry--2 or 3 days old.

- In a bowl beat 2 eggs until light and frothy. Add ½ cup cream, a pinch of salt and a dash of nutmeg.
- Soak bread, a few pieces at a time, so that they absorb the egg-cream mixture thoroughly.

- Fry bread on both sides to a golden colour.
