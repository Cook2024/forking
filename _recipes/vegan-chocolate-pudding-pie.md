title: "Vegan Chocolate Pudding Pie"

tags: ["desserts", "vegan"]

directions:
- Bake pie crust according to whatever pie crust you’re using (or if you have an oreo crust, just unwrap that bad boy.)
- Make filling:
- Put tofu on a paper towel. You aren’t pressing it you’re just getting the most obvious water off. Let it sit while you melt the chocolate. Melt chocolate in microwave. Add granulated sugar once it is melted. Mix. Add the instant coffee into the oat milk. Mix to dissolve.
- Get out your blender, add everything to the blender (I mean, not the pie crust). Blend it on high (or medium high if you have a very strong blender). It will become light and fluffy.
- Splorp into pie crust, smooth out. Chill for a few hours with plastic wrap over the top. When you’re ready to eat get some premade vegan whipped topping (my friend bought coconut redi-whip, I’ve also used non dairy cool whip alternative, it doesn’t really matter. imo it should taste fake to best approximate the artificial delight of a chocolate pudding pie that you thawed for dessert) and add it to the top of the pie. Lo! Pie!

components:
- 1 vegan pie crust (I used Mrs Smith’s, from the grocery store, but that’s not an endorsement) If they have oreo crust that’s the ideal one to use here.
- 9.6 oz or 270 grams (1 1/2 cups if you’re nasty) vegan chocolate (I used a mixture of 70% and 62%, Tony’s and Scharffenberger, it’s most important that the chocolate taste good since that is most of what you’re tasting. If you have a vegan milk chocolate, I think some of that in here would be so choice.)
- 2 tbs oat milk (almond for KFP!)
- 1 tsp instant coffee
- 1 tbs rum (I used black rum, but you could also use a coffee liqueur, non-alcoholic rum, or just more vanilla and instant coffee)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla
- 1 tbs granulated sugar (you can use more if you want a sweeter pie, I’m not your boss)
- 340 g silken tofu (this was a full package for me, nice!)
- pinch of salt
- Canned vegan whipped cream alternative, to serve

This is a pie for everyone, for any occasion. This is a great summertime pie (no heat!) but also a great thanksgiving pie (french silk pie is for thanksgiving, obviously, she’s a legend, she’s an icon, and this is… basically that?). Really, it’s an all season pie. It's also delicious and very easy. I love this pie!
