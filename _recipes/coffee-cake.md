ingredients:
- 330g unsalted butter (or 50/50 butter and baking margerine), softened, plus extra for greasing
- 330g caster sugar
- 6 medium eggs
- 330g [UK] self-raising flour. (If you're from the US, your self-raising flour has added salt so instead use the same quantity of all-purpose flour and add a generous 2 tsp of baking powder)
- 6 tbsp strong espresso coffee
- (for the benefit of those in North America) 1 cup equals 150g 
- "For the coffee cream cheese icing: 1 batch of cream cheese icing and 2 tsp extremely strong espresso coffee"
- "For the coffee syrup: 100g caster sugar, 2 tbsp strong espresso coffee, 70ml water"
- Chocolate-dipped coffee beans, to decorate

directions:
- Preheat overn to 180&deg;C (160&deg;C fan, 350&deg;F, gas mark 4). Grease and line the bases of two deep 18cm sandwich or cake tins.
- Cream the butter and sugar in a stand mixer until pale and fluffy. 
- Add the eggs, two at a time, beating well and alternating with 2 tablespoons of the flour before adding the next two eggs. Scrape the bowl down after each flour addition.
- Add the rest of the flour and mix on a slow speed until just combined. 
- Stir in the espresso.
- Divide the mixture evenly between the two tins and smooth with a palette knife - you can weigh them to check that you have the same amount in each. 
- Bake for 25-30 minutes until the cakes spring back to the touch. Leave in the tins to cool completely.
- Make the cream cheese icing. Add the coffee essence. If the icing is still a bit soft, chill it in the fridge for 1 hour.
- To make the syrup, heat the sugar, coffee and water together in a pan until the sugar is fully dissolved.
- Trim any doming on the top of the sponges, then slice each cake horizontally into two even layers.
- Place one layer on a cake board or plate, drizzle with some syrup, then spread with coffee cream cheese icing.
- Repeat with the next two layers of cake, then place the final sponge layer on top.
- Coat the cake with the rest of the coffee cream cheese icing and decorate with chocolate-dipped coffee beans.
